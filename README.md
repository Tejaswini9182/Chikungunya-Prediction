# Chikungunya Prediction using Machine Learning Models and Python Libraries

Chikungunya is a disease caused by a virus that spreads through the bites of infected mosquitoes, primarily Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus. People infected with chikungunya often experience symptoms such as fever, fatigue, vomiting, arthritis, conjunctivitis, chills, swelling, and rashes. In severe cases, the disease can cause prolonged joint pain that affects a personâ€™s mobility and quality of life. These symptoms, however, are not unique to chikungunya and may overlap with other diseases like dengue or malaria, making it difficult to identify chikungunya accurately and quickly. 
To address this challenge, we are developing a system that can predict whether a person has chikungunya or not based on their symptoms. The prediction models will include Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and. This system uses advanced machine learning techniques to analyse symptom inputs such as fever, fatigue, vomiting, arthritis, and other common indicators. The goal is to provide an accurate prediction of chikungunya based on these symptoms without the need for expensive or time-consuming laboratory tests.
